- The objective of this assignment is to present two **fully documented**, **human readable** R scripts that are **dynamically linked**.

- The R script file to run first is Run_This.R. This contains the dynamic link to women.R and also the R code for precipitation data.

> Style guide: We use Hadley WickhamÂ´s Style Guide from [r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).

- women.R looks at and explores a dataset with the average height and weight of US women.

- Run_This.R looks at and explores a dataset of the average annual rainfall (precipiation) of 70 US cities.

- Finally, we made a pull request to rosecamille/CSSDA-Assigment-1 to add a citation of the software to both of their R scripts.
